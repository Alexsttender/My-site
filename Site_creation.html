        <h1 class="greetingsmain">Creating a website</h1>
        <br> <!-- instead of moving text to CSS, when creating simple site tags, easy indentation helps better -->
        <h2 class="smallheaders">Why did I create a website? After all, this is the front-end!</h2><br>
            <p>front-end and back-end are two inseparable things. They are part of a single whole and are engaged in what they are trying to provide,
                working in conjunction, the client is able to receive certain services.
                 Without understanding how the frontend works, it is difficult for a backend-developer to understand -
                and what exactly does it do? Why it creates server programs and how and through what the client will interact with them.
                Understanding such things as-JavaScript, HTML,CSS, and so on, in fact, are necessary for high-quality and conscious work, it is very important to understand
                a common whole and guided by this already bring your own contribution to the common whole<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, of course, you always want to effectively demonstrate your capabilities! Various services and websites provide the opportunity to
                communicate, demonstrate and show your knowledge, post your projects, and so on. But what if all this is combined in one place? Each
                a creative person strives to translate his knowledge and talents into something unusual, whole and complete. I decided that this site will be able to demonstrate
                my knowledge, implement my ideas and demonstrate my projects more clearly and generally. Especially since in the end-it's a challenge, and
                by answering this challenge, I can increase my knowledge and improve my skills. But in the end it's just more convenient
            </p><br>
        <h2 class="smallheaders">How did I create this site? What difficulties have I encountered?</h2><br>
            <p>In fact, HTML, CSS and JavaScript themselves are convenient and pleasant things, the code written in them is more or less clear, and in general, it is a fun activity
                However, unfortunately, I had to fill in a huge number of gaps in my knowledge in this area by trial and error in order to create a website.
                There is a lot of material on the individual components of the site layout technology, but in fact they are very numerous and scattered and almost never answer a particular problem.
                So I, sometimes by being wide of the mark, just came to understand and implement different technologies, thanks to which I built this site<br>
            </p><br><br>
            <p>
                The basis for me was, first of all, the idea. From the very beginning, I wrote and depicted the idea of what my site should look like and what it is for, in fact
                you will need it. I understood that there must be some complex elements, individual pages, articles. I created it primarily out of necessity
                to bring to life the flight of my thought, in the way of which there were a large number of obstacles.
